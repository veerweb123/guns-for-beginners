                <h3>Parts of a Semi-Automatic Handgun</h3>
                <p><strong>The Grip:</strong> The grip on the semi-automatic handgun isn't just the handhold for the weapon. The grip is hollow and houses the weapon's ammunition in a magazine. The bottom of the grip is open and is called the magazine port or loading port. It also has a magazine release button within the grip.</p>
                <p><strong>The Magazine:</strong> The magazine is a removable ammunition feeding and storage device. It can be separated from the weapon when empty and replaced with a full magazine. Cartridges are stacked against spring tension which allows the magazine to feed each round into the weapon's chamber. Magazines allow semi-automatic handguns to fire more rounds than revolvers and are much faster to reload.</p>
                <p><strong>The Magazine Release:</strong> This is a button generally located in front of the grip behind the trigger guard. When a loaded magazine is inserted into the weapon, the shooter will hear an audible click. This is the magazine release mechanism locking the magazine in place. To remove or replace the magazine, the shooter must press the button.</p>
                <p><strong>The Slide:</strong> The top portion of the weapon that slides back and forth when fired. Pulling the slide back loads a cartridge into the chamber, and firing the weapon forces the slide to the rear, ejecting the spent cartridge and re-cocking the hammer for the next round.</p>
                <p><strong>The Safety or Decocking Lever:</strong> Often located below the rear sight, this lever can lower the hammer and prevent the weapon from firing when in the 'safe' position. To fire, the lever must be moved to the 'fire' position.</p>
                <p><strong>The Frame:</strong> The single part of the weapon that the slide rides on, often made of metal or polymer. Glock handguns are famous for their polymer frames.</p>
                <p><strong>The Takedown Lever:</strong> Located above the trigger, this releases the slide and barrel to field strip the weapon.</p>
                <p><strong>The Slide Stop:</strong> A lever behind the takedown lever that locks the slide open after the last round is fired. Pressing it releases the slide to snap forward, readying the next round.</p>
                <p><strong>The Recoil Spring and Guide:</strong> Located under the barrel, these components return the slide forward, chambering the next round after each shot.</p>
